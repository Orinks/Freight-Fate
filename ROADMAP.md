# Freight Fate Roadmap

## Current dev branch

- [x] Realistic freight markets and facilities: metro route nodes now expand
      into hundreds of representative shippers and receivers, with stable
      facility IDs, ship/receive cargo roles, regional specialization, curated
      source notes, deterministic offline templates, and save-compatible
      facility-aware job generation.
- [x] Playable air-brake pressure mechanics: cold starts need a short air
      build before the parking brake can release, service-brake applications
      consume air, low-air and spring-brake thresholds are spoken, and active
      trip saves preserve the air-brake state.
- [ ] Dedicated air-system audio assets: replace the current spoken
      compressor-ready cue with an air-dryer purge and low-air buzzer once the
      sound library grows those effects.

## Next up: 1.6 polish and realism

A consolidation pass focused on closing realism gaps and removing rough
edges rather than adding new systems. Several items overlap the trooper
milestone below (speeding consequences especially); ship whichever slice
is ready first and fold the rest in.

### Driver economics

- [x] **Negative-balance recovery (softlock fix).** Shipped as a
  **dispatcher pay advance**: from the terminal hub or any in-trip rest
  stop, a broke driver (cash under $400) can draw $500 against the next
  load, capped at $1,500 outstanding, repaid automatically out of the next
  delivery settlement (never below zero, remainder carried). Tracked on
  `Profile.pay_advance`; deterministic and save-compatible. Money still
  goes negative freely for fines/tows by design, but broke-and-empty is no
  longer a dead end.

### Fatigue and driver responsibility

- **Drowsiness consequences.** Today fatigue only narrows hazard reaction
  windows (`hos.reaction_window_mult`) and plays yawn / rumble-strip
  audio; with hazards rare it has little teeth. Add real stakes: severe
  fatigue (`FATIGUE_SEVERE`, 80+) should cause occasional involuntary
  **microsleep lane drift** events (a forced lane-keeping correction or a
  rumble-strip wake with a short reaction window), escalating toward a
  forced stop. Tie into the relaxed-mode philosophy below: in relaxed
  mode drowsiness, fueling, HOS, and repairs become the *main* thing the
  player manages.

- [x] **Relaxed mode should feel relaxed.** Shipped: `Trip` now takes a
  `hazard_scale` and relaxed mode passes `hos.hazard_scale("relaxed")`
  (0.2), so random road hazards are ~5x rarer while weather and night
  still modulate the ones that occur. Driver-responsibility systems
  (hours of service, fueling, repairs, fatigue) carry the relaxed loop;
  `realistic` mode is unchanged. Possible follow-up: also thin out traffic
  density and reduce inspection/patrol frequency in relaxed mode.

- [x] **Grounded, context-aware hazards.** Shipped: the flat per-region
  string pool (which could announce farm equipment merging onto a freeway
  or a dust devil on a clear day) is replaced by a tagged `HAZARDS`
  catalog and `eligible_hazards(region, weather, terrain, hour)`. A hazard
  is only drawn when region, weather, terrain, *and* time of day all allow
  it: standing water/hydroplaning need wet weather; snow squalls, bridge
  ice, and shaded-grade black ice need snow; fog brake-lights need fog;
  crosswind and dust storms need high wind in open regions; rockfall and
  runaway-truck need mountain terrain; deer/elk are dawn/dusk/night-biased
  with regional species. Follow-up ideas: tie hazard *frequency* to
  corridor traffic density and proximity to metros; seasonal weather so
  snow is winter-only; condition animal strikes on rural vs urban miles.

### Driving feel

- **Gear / launch realism.** Partly addressed: gross mass is now
  cargo-weight-aware (tare + payload), so a heavy load accelerates slower,
  lugs on grades, and burns more fuel, and an empty deadhead is light and
  brisk -- the truck mass is no longer a flat 36 t. **Still open:** the
  launch itself is too brisk even fully loaded, because it is
  traction-limited at ~0.33 g and the automatic upshifts almost instantly
  (`AUTO_UPSHIFT_RPM` 1750). Remaining options: lower the effective launch
  traction / drive force at low speed and/or widen the low-gear dwell
  before the auto upshifts. Needs playtesting to avoid feeling sluggish to
  the point of frustration.

### Speed limits and speeding

- **Corridor highway speed limits.** `speed_limit_at` returns a flat
  `BASE_SPEED_LIMIT_MPH` (70) everywhere except construction/zone
  overrides. Route legs already carry a `highway` name; map highway class
  / region to a posted limit (rural interstate 70-80, urban 55-65, two-lane
  lower) and surface it through the same zone/announcement plumbing so the
  posted limit changes by corridor. Where real OSM `maxspeed` data is
  available for a corridor, prefer it.

- **Speeding leeway and consequences.** Leeway already exists: a strike is
  only recorded above `limit + 9` mph held for 6 s (`_update_speeding`),
  and strikes already convert to settlement fines
  (`_speeding_settlement_fine`). What's missing is *salience* and
  *immediacy* — the cost lands silently at delivery. The trooper milestone
  (below) is the intended home for visible, immediate enforcement (getting
  pulled over, on-the-spot fines). Confirm the ~10 mph leeway feels right
  and make the strike→cost link audible when a strike is recorded.

### Realism north star (ongoing)

The guiding goal for 1.6 and beyond: make every system as true to real
trucking as the 2-D, audio-first design allows, short of a 3-D driving
model. New realism ideas land here, then graduate into a concrete slice
above when picked up. Existing items already serving this goal: grounded
hazards (done), corridor speed limits, gear/launch realism, drowsiness
consequences, and the trooper/enforcement milestone below.

Net-new realism candidates, roughly by area:

- [x] **Weather and seasons.** Shipped: the career clock now yields a day of
  the year and season, and `sim/season.py` models a regional temperature
  (seasonal + daily swing). Temperature reconciles the simulated draw --
  precipitation falls as snow when freezing, snow thaws to rain when warm,
  storms need warmth -- so snow is a cold-season risk and thunderstorms a
  warm-season one, and the weather-gated hazards inherit that automatically
  (winter ice/squalls, summer hail). Seasons are opt-in via `WeatherSystem`'s
  `game_hours` so seed-based tests stay deterministic; real-weather mode keeps
  driving conditions (and thus hazard context) from live data. Follow-up:
  black-ice risk on clear cold mornings after wet roads (currently ice rides
  on active snow), and seasonal daylight length.
- **Physics and the truck.** Cargo-weight-aware gross mass is done for
  acceleration, grade lugging, fuel burn, and now braking: the foundation
  brakes have a fixed force ceiling sized for the rated gross, so loads over
  the rated weight are brake-capacity limited -- they stop longer and heat
  the brakes faster -- while loads at or below the rated gross are unchanged.
  Remaining: tire and brake wear over a truck's life, and finer grade-based
  fuel burn.
- **Traffic and corridors.** Hazard and congestion frequency scaled by how
  busy a corridor actually is (urban interstates dense, empty plains
  sparse); rush-hour slowdowns near metros; realistic merge/exit traffic.
- **Hours of service.** Split-sleeper provision and the 60/70-hour cycle
  with 34-hour restart (the HOS model intentionally skips these today).
- **Local delivery realism.** The destination-local approach legs already
  sketched under World: surface-street miles, gate speeds, and dock
  approaches after the highway portion.
- **Business realism.** The company-driver→owner-operator arc, loans, and
  insurance already sketched under Business.

## Next up: state troopers and law enforcement

Speeding, HOS/ELD compliance, and route enforcement are now one visible
system instead of unrelated end-of-trip deductions and generic random
inspections. The first shipped slice uses route-backed contexts where the
current corridor data supports them: weigh-station POIs, construction
zones, checkpoints/high-patrol corridors, and seeded patrol windows.
Events carry evidence such as HOS/ELD violations or construction-zone
speeding, and serious HOS violations trigger an out-of-service 10-hour
reset instead of only a fine.

The ELD/HOS model is grounded in FMCSA's property-carrier summary:
11 hours of driving after 10 consecutive hours off duty, a 14-hour
driving window after coming on duty, a 30-minute break after 8 cumulative
driving hours that may be any non-driving period, and 60/70-hour cycle
rules with 34-hour restart as a future expansion. Primary references:
https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/summary-hours-service-regulations
and https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-of-service. ELD save data
records duty status, time, and route evidence in the spirit of FMCSA's ELD
function guidance: https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/eld-functions-faqs.

### Design sketch

- **Patrol presence.** Each route leg gets a patrol intensity from its
  region and highway (urban corridors hot, empty plains cold, construction
  zones always hot), modulated by time of day (speed traps at rush hour,
  DUI patrols at night). The CB radio is the counterplay: chatter like
  "bear at mile marker 12" gives attentive players a spoken heads-up a
  few miles out.
- **Getting pulled over.** Speeding 10+ over inside a patrol's window (or
  blowing past a weigh station while flagged) triggers a siren behind you.
  The player must signal with X (reusing the exit system's muscle memory),
  brake to a stop on the shoulder, and sit through a spoken stop: license
  and logbook check, then a ticket, a warning (reputation and demeanor
  matter), or an order to a nearby weigh station for a full inspection.
- **Consequences.** Immediate fines replace the silent at-delivery
  deduction (escalating like HOS fines: 150 to 1,200 dollars), reputation
  hits, and an "out of service" order for serious HOS violations: 10
  hours parked where you stand. Ignoring the siren is a felony stop:
  spike strips ahead, a huge fine, and possibly losing the load.
- **Settings.** The normal HOS setting now defaults to realistic, keeps
  relaxed for accessibility and pacing, and labels the non-enforced mode
  as a debug bypass rather than ordinary play. A separate law-enforcement
  setting remains open only if enforcement grows beyond HOS and route
  safety evidence.
- **Audio needed.** Siren approach/behind loops, CB radio squelch and
  chatter, an officer voice channel (the SAPI event voice fits), spike
  strip. Added as Ogg Vorbis assets under
  `src/freight_fate/assets/sounds/`.
- **Open questions.** Should troopers notice damage (a visibly wrecked
  truck invites a stop)? Do warnings expire? Does reputation lower the
  ticket odds, or just the fine?

## Future ideas (post-1.0)

### Gameplay depth
- [ ] Cargo loading/securing minigame
- [x] Hours-of-service fatigue and mandatory rest planning (1.5.0)
- [x] Highway exits: signal with X, slow for the ramp, brake to the stop
- [x] Cruise control (K), with hazard and braking auto-cancel
- [x] Region-flavored road hazards (dust devils, deer, rockfall, ...)
- [x] HOS-aware realistic deadlines (driving + breaks + sleep + slack)
- [ ] State troopers and law enforcement (designed above, next milestone)
- [ ] Special event jobs (oversize loads, urgent medical freight)
- [ ] Trailer types with handling differences

### World
- [x] More cities and regional highways (1.4.0)
- [x] Day/night cycle with audio shifts (1.5.0); seasons still open
- [ ] City-specific ambience and landmarks
- [ ] Destination-local facility legs: after the highway trip reaches the
      destination city, hand the player onto a short local approach to the
      receiver gate. Route display and GPS cues should clearly separate
      highway miles from local gate approach, saves should resume on the
      correct leg, and facility data should carry enough road name, distance,
      gate speed, and dock-approach detail to make warehouses, terminals,
      ports, and industrial yards feel distinct.

### Business
- [ ] Company-driver to owner-operator career arc. Resolve the current
      thematic mismatch: the mechanics are already owner-operator (you buy and
      upgrade your own trucks and pay fuel, repairs, and tolls), but the
      progression flavor reads like a company driver. Reframe as a single arc --
      *start* as a company driver (paid per mile, no asset costs or fixed
      overhead), then earn your way to owning a truck, at which point fuel,
      maintenance, insurance, and any loan payment come out of revenue. Expand
      the career ladder (~20 levels; today `LEVEL_XP` tables 9 then +1500/level)
      to pace that transition and the matching upgrade unlocks.
- [ ] Company ownership: hire AI drivers, buy trucks
- [ ] Loans and insurance

### Platforms and community
- [x] Binary releases (Nuitka) per platform
- [ ] Steam/itch.io distribution
- [ ] Localization of all speech strings
- [ ] Optional online leaderboards
