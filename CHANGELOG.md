# Changelog

## 1.1.0 — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Real-world weather** (Settings → Weather source): live current
  conditions for each city from the free
  [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) API (no key required). WMO weather
  codes map onto the game's conditions, including strong-wind promotion.
  Fetches run in background threads with a 15-minute cache; offline or on
  any failure the simulated weather takes over seamlessly.
- City coordinates in the world data.
- With real weather enabled, route planning's W key speaks live conditions
  for the cities along the route, and the V key while driving reports
  "live conditions" for the city you are heading toward.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-06-09

First release. Complete rewrite of the prototype.

### Added
- Career mode: jobs, route planning, deliveries, money, experience levels,
  reputation, and cargo endorsements (refrigerated at level 2, high-value at
  level 4).
- Tuned Class 8 truck physics: ten-speed transmission (manual with clutch or
  automatic), torque curve, grades, traction limits, stalling, brake fade,
  engine braking, and realistic fuel economy (~6 mpg loaded).
- 21-city, 27-leg interstate network with Dijkstra route finding and multiple
  route options per job.
- Dynamic regional weather (eight conditions) affecting grip, drag, and safe
  speed, with forecasts and thunder.
- Trip events: construction and traffic zones, road hazards with reaction
  windows, rest stop refueling, out-of-fuel roadside rescue, speeding fines.
- Screen reader output through Prism (`prismatoid`): NVDA, JAWS, SAPI,
  VoiceOver, Speech Dispatcher, and more, with silent fallback.
- Fully synthesized CC0 sound library (43 effects) and three original music
  tracks, all reproducible from `tools/generate_audio.py`.
- RPM-crossfaded engine audio, speed-tracking road noise, weather ambience.
- Accessible UI: spoken menus with wrap-around and first-letter navigation,
  contextual F1 help, accessible text entry, three speech verbosity levels,
  imperial/metric units, and a visible text mirror of all speech.
- First-drive tutorial, six-page in-game manual.
- Atomic JSON saves with multiple driver profiles.
- uv-based packaging, cross-platform CI (Windows + Linux), 67-test suite.

### Removed
- SRAL DLL dependency (replaced by the Prism Python package).
- Legacy prototype source tree, duplicate data files, and debug artifacts.
