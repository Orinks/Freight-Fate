"""Curated statutory street speed limits, with the code section behind each.

A city street is almost never tagged in OpenStreetMap -- `service` ways carry
a `maxspeed` on 0.2 to 1.3 percent of their length, `residential` on 2 to 14
(`tools/maxspeed_coverage.py`) -- so the last mile into a facility cannot be
read off the map. It can be read off the law: every state's vehicle code sets
a default limit for business and residence districts that applies precisely
when no sign is posted.

That makes this layer READ rather than assumed, in the sense CLAUDE.md means
it: each number below is quoted from a published statute, and `citation` and
`url` are there so a later reader can re-verify instead of trusting. The same
discipline as `tools/toll_rates.py`, which is the model this follows.

Fields per state:
  business_mph    the business-district default, or None where the code has
                  no such category
  residence_mph   the residence-district default, or None
  urban_mph       used only by codes that write a single "urban district"
                  figure instead of the two above
  citation        the section itself, e.g. "Va. Code Ann. Sec. 46.2-874"
  title           that section's official name
  url             the legislature or official code publisher
  rule_type       "absolute" or "prima facie" -- whether the limit is
                  rebuttable, which is why two states with the same number
                  are not the same law
  signs_required  False where the statute governs with no sign present, which
                  is the case this table exists for
  truck_note      any commercial-vehicle difference, else ""
  verified        True only where the figure was read off a primary source.
                  An unverified row NEVER reaches the game: the runtime skips
                  it and falls back, so a row here that could not be confirmed
                  changes nothing rather than shipping a guess as law.
  notes           what a later reader needs -- local authority to set a
                  different limit, a recent amendment, a source conflict
