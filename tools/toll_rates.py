"""Curated 5-axle commercial toll rates, with the source for every figure.

The map's 46 toll events were all ``estimated`` -- plausible numbers nobody had
checked. This is the researched replacement: each entry names the authority's
own schedule or calculator it came from, so a later reader can re-verify rather
than trust.

Fields per entry:
  transponder  what a rig with a working tag pays
  plate        what it costs without one; equal to ``transponder`` where the
               authority gives no discount, which is commoner than expected
  directions   ("both",) unless the crossing collects one way only
  src          the authority document or calculator the figure came from
  verified     True when read off a primary source; False when DERIVED (say
               so in ``src``) and therefore not safe to ship as fact

Three rules learned the hard way while assembling this:

* A figure no pass could confirm does NOT go in with ``verified=True`` to look
  tidy. Oklahoma sat unverified through two attempts before a third read the
  live pikepass.com calculator -- its 2025 annual report genuinely stops at a
  2024 rate column, which is why document searches kept failing. The estimates
  held in the meantime were 2 to 7 percent off in BOTH directions: close enough
  to look right, wrong enough to matter.
* Published web pages go stale. The Carquinez and Benicia-Martinez bridge pages
  still showed $30.50 when the adopted BATA resolution had moved to $40.50 for
  2026; the formally approved schedule beats the marketing page.
* Ask where the tolled road actually GOES before pricing a leg. A confident
  source said I-64 leaves Charleston toll-free; it does not, it runs concurrent
  with I-77 down the tolled Turnpike for 60 miles first. The mirror of that:
  I-70 tolling stops at Breezewood, so pricing Pittsburgh to Hagerstown as a
  full turnpike run would overcharge for free road. Route definition causes
  more error here than arithmetic does.
