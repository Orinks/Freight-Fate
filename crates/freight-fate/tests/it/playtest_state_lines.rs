//! The mapped state line, heard on a whole delivery (a case of

//!
//! # One route per test, on purpose
//!
//! Each case here drives a complete 500-mile delivery, and the four of them
//! together were once a single test with a loop in it. That one test took
//! 54.8 seconds of the suite's 123 -- and because it is one test, it is one
//! thread: it set the floor for the whole run no matter how many cores the
//! machine had. Four tests over the same four routes is the same coverage on
//! four threads, and a failure now names the route it happened on instead of
//! whichever iteration got there first.

/// The mapped state line is announced, once, ahead of the city it precedes.

/// the voice actually read out. `ctx.message_log` is the RECORD: every road
/// line the drive produced, in order, whether or not the voice got to it --
/// which is what the review keys are for.
///
/// The surveyed crossing is checked at the ear, because that is the line
/// this test is about and the player does hear it. The city passing line is
/// checked at the record, because it is chatter and now competes for the
/// voice on the same real-time budget a player's drive gives it (see
/// `PlaytestHarness`'s clock): a route waypoint fires its junction
/// instructions -- "keep right for I-24 East toward Atlanta", "continue on
/// I-24 for 247 miles toward Atlanta" -- in the same few seconds, they own
/// the channel, and "Passing Nashville, Tennessee." is dropped as stale
/// ambient behind them in every seeded run of this route. That is the pacer
/// doing its job on the least urgent and most redundant of the three lines,
/// so the assertion follows the record rather than pretending the ear got
/// it. What this test is about survives untouched: the crossing is spoken,
/// once, at the surveyed mile, and the city line never carries the
/// unmapped-route fallback prefix.
