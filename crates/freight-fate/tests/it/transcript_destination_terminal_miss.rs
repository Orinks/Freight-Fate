//! Blowing the stop at the end of the destination ramp loops back
//! (port of `tests/test_destination_terminal_miss.py`).
//!
//! A destination terminal with no street chain used to simply wait when the
//! truck rolled past it at speed: the arrival line was spoken once, the ramp
//! counted down past it forever, and nothing else was ever said. A player
//! circled the ramp for minutes with the route status frozen and quit to the
//! menu (owner playtest, Buffalo to Albany, 2026-08-12). It now loops back
//! through the next safe turnaround like every other missed stop on the route.
//!
//! Two seams differ from the Python file, both deliberately:
//!
//! * Python patched `ctx.say_event` and read `(text, interrupt)` off the
//!   patch. Here the lines come off `ctx.speech`, below the driving verbosity
//!   ladder and the event pacer -- what a player actually hears. Every line
//!   asserted here is navigation-priority arrival speech that no rung
//!   silences, so the expectations are unchanged.
//! * Python monkeypatched `_open_facility_arrival` to a recorder. A Rust
//!   method cannot be swapped, so the drive is on the stack and the arrival
//!   is asserted by what it DID: the latch it sets and the pull-in beat it
//!   replaces the drive with.
