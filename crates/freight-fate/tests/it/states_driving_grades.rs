//! The grade advisory: `update_grade_advisory` in
//! `states/driving_updates/hazards.rs`, plus the terse gate over it.
//!
//! Ported from the advisory block at the bottom of
//! `tests/test_driving_features.py` (`_advisory_setup` and the six cases
//! under it).
//!
//! Python reaches these conditions by replacing `trip.grade_at` with a
//! closure. There is no such seam here, and faking one would test the fake:
//! every case below bakes REAL grade segments onto a real leg and lets
//! `Trip::grade_at` read them the way it reads the shipped corridor data, so
//! what runs is the same lookup the game runs. That costs one thing --
//! segments are fixed spans rather than a function, so a profile that Python
//! could bend mid-scan is laid out as a span here, and where a case needed a
//! second hill the truck is moved along the real profile to reach it instead
//! of the profile being rewritten under a stationary truck.
