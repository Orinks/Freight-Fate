//! Hazards from the moment they arm to the line that says they are behind
//! you: `states/driving_events/trip_events.rs` (the arming and folding
//! branches), `states/driving_updates/hazards.rs` (resolution and the
//! assist's own application) and the earcon map in `states/driving_core.rs`.
//!
//! Ported from the hazard block at the top of
//! `tests/test_driving_features.py` plus
//! `test_terse_hazard_drops_brake_now_instruction` and
//! `test_a_folded_hazard_does_not_follow_the_truck_into_its_new_lane`.
//!
//! Python's `monkeypatch.setattr(app.ctx, "say_event", ...)` replaced the

//! delivery layer runs and the lines are read back off the capture, which
//! means the pacer is in the loop; where a case fires two hazards in one
