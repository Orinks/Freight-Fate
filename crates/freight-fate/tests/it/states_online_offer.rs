//! Port of `tests/test_online_offer.py`: the one-time first-run orinks.net
//! offer.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the network: the offer itself makes no calls, and the
//! accept path is asserted by the state it pushes, not by running setup.
//!
//! Most tests here drive the state directly, which says nothing about how the
//! offer composes with the lines spoken around it. The two spoken-order tests
//! at the bottom drive a real career creation through the app instead, and
//! wait on the main menu port.
