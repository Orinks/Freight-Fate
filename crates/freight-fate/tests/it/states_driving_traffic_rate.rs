//! How often traffic forces the truck to slow, measured rather than felt.
//!
//! Owner, 2026-08-24: "I don't like the idea that I have to brake when I (the
//! player) am in the only lane available and it forces me to brake. In those
//! situations you'd brake hard, ie the emergency brake. But it happens far too
//! often in my experience."
//!
//! "Far too often" is a rate, so this file produces one. The sweep drives
//! seeded deliveries over a spread of real corridors, records every occasion
//! the trip raised a lead-vehicle hazard -- the "Change lanes or brake!" /
//! "Brake!" call that the automatic brake then acts on -- and reports events
//! per hundred miles split by how many lanes the road has in the direction of
//! travel.
//!
//! Every run pins its trip seed and its weather. An unseeded delivery draws
//! its own road and its own sky, and rain alone moves every NPC's speed by up
//! to fourteen miles an hour, which is most of the effect being measured.
//!
//! The sweep itself is `#[ignore]`d: it is a measurement, and it drives
//! hundreds of route miles. The cases below it are the assertions the
//! measurement earned.
