//! Nothing in a test process may put a byte on the real network.
//!
//! Two live seams met here. The online services -- presence, cloud saves,
//! both journal outboxes -- are built by `App::new_headless` with
//! `..Default::default()`, which is the LIVE transport on a background
//! thread; the only thing keeping the suite's heartbeats off orinks.net was
//! that a pinned data directory yields no driver identity, and a test that
//! adopted one would have posted as the owner. The live-data feeds had no
//! seam at all: a drive with real weather on builds its own NWS provider and
//! asks for every city on the route, which the suite was measured doing
//! eleven times a run against api.weather.gov.
//!
//! Read `freight_fate::net` for the mechanism. In one line: the network is a
//! capability `main()` grants, a test binary has no `main()` of the game's,
//! and so every send in a test refuses, records the address, and panics
//! naming it.
