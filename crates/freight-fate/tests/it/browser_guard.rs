//! Nothing in a test process may put a page in a real web browser.
//!
//! On 2026-08-24 the driver setup page opened in the owner's browser while
//! the suite was running: `open_url` reached the live site unless a test had
//! remembered to install an override, and the override lived in a
//! thread-local, so a page opened from any other thread was never covered by
//! it at all. Both halves of that are what this file pins.
//!
//! Read `freight_fate::browser` for the mechanism. In one line: the browser
//! is a capability `main()` grants, a test binary has no `main()` of the
//! game's, and so `open_url` in a test refuses, records the address, and
//! panics naming it.
