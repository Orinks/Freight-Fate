//! Where the engine brake actually comes on, measured rather than argued.
//!
//! Owner report, 2026-08-24, two parts: "on uphill ascents the truck should
//! gain speed instead of using the engine brakes", and "edge cases where the
//! jake still activates on flat road with cruise on -- unless that's real
//! behaviour, in which case leave it".
//!
//! And a third report, 2026-08-24: "the jake activates on every single
//! descent it seems, even shallow descent like 1-3 percent."
//!
//! A retarder is a device for holding a loaded truck BACK. On a climb the
//! truck should be building speed, or at worst holding what it has, so a
//! retarder there is a controller asking for the opposite of what the road
//! needs. Two rules answer that between them, and until the shallow-descent
//! report they were one:
//!
//! * `DrivingState::on_downgrade` -- the two percent line the spoken G readout
//!   and the town ordinance exemption draw -- says whether the road is going
//!   downhill, which is what a retarder already up is HELD by.
//! * `DrivingState::retarder_warranted` says whether the service brakes could
//!   hold this hill on their own, which is what an assist may RAISE the
//!   retarder for. Derived, not chosen: see its own doc comment and
//!   `states_driving_jake_line`, which measures it against real drum heat.
//!
//! This file drives real frames over real baked road and COUNTS, so that "does
//! the jake come on where it should not" has an answer with numbers under it
//! instead of a bench built to match a memory. The grade-band table is the one
//! to read against the shallow-descent report: before the split it showed 33
//! seconds of retarder on two to three percent and 137 on three to four; after
//! it, zero in both.
//!
//! Every road here is seeded and its weather pinned: an unseeded delivery
//! draws its own route and its own sky, and letting that draw decide which
//! shape got measured is how three separate faults hid this week.
//!
//! Run `cargo test -p freight-fate --test it jake_sweep -- --nocapture` to
//! read the tables; the assertion at the bottom is what the sweep pins.
