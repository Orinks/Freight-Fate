//! The packaged game must never open a terminal window.
//!
//! Whether it does is decided by one 16-bit field in the executable's PE
//! header, written by the linker from `#![windows_subsystem = "windows"]` in
//! `main.rs`. There is no way to observe it from inside a running process --
//! a build that lost the attribute looks perfectly healthy to every other
//! test in the suite, and the first person to notice is a tester who launches
//! the game and gets a black window beside it. So the assertion is made
//! against the built binary itself, which is the thing that regressed.
