//! Transcript-backed playtests for the months-long 1.9 career arc
//! (port of `tests/test_career_arc_playtest.py`).
//!
//! These drive the real game states end to end: a promotion across a fleet
//! tier must speak the level-up, then the tractor hand-over, all reachable
//! line by line from the settlement menu with the keyboard.
//!
//! `tests/career_1_9_scenarios.py` is a helper module, not a test file, and
//! the parity sweep does not list it as something to port on its own. The two
//! presets this file needs are inlined below as [`CareerStage`]; anything
//! else that wants them should lift them into a shared support module.
//!
//! Seam note: the Python harness patched `ctx.say`/`say_event`, so its
//! transcript was every line the states SUBMITTED. The Rust harness records
//! at `ctx.speech`, under the driving verbosity ladder and the event pacer,
//! so it is what a player hears. Nothing here changes as a result -- the
//! settlement menu speaks its rows on the main channel, which neither the
//! ladder nor the pacer touches.
