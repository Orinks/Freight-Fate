//! What "dodgeable" means, and what it is not allowed to decide.
//!
//! Owner, 2026-08-24: traffic forces the truck to brake on a road with
//! nowhere to go, and there the response should be firmer than where there is
//! somewhere to go. The words already told the two roads apart -- one lane
//! gets "Brake!", a road with an open lane gets "Change lanes or brake!" --
//! and the physics did not. Worse than undifferentiated: every lead-vehicle
//! hazard was emitted dodgeable whatever the road, so the driver with no lane
//! was handed `LANE_TAP_CHANGE_S` of allowance for a move they could not make
//! and the assist waited it out while the truck kept closing.
//!
//! Two separate questions came out of one flag, and this file is the pin on
//! keeping them apart:
//!
//! * `dodgeable` -- IS THERE SOMEWHERE TO GO. The thing sits in one lane and
//!   the road has an open lane on this side. It buys the lane-change
//!   allowance and nothing else.
//! * `in_lane` -- IS THE THING IN OUR LANE, as against spanning the road.
//!   With `hazard_lead_mph` it decides the speed braking ALONE has to reach.
//!
//! The order mattered. Flipping `dodgeable` without splitting the target off
//! it first would have dragged the truck to `HAZARD_SAFE_MPH` for a moving
//! vehicle, which is Brandon's regression of 2026-08-23 all over again.
