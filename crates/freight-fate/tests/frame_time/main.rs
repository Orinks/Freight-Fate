//! How long a frame takes while the game is being DRIVEN, and a gate that
//! fails when that regresses.
//!
//! `bench_drive.rs` next door times `DrivingState::update` alone on a short
//! plains route. This file times the whole per-frame path the shipped loop
//! runs -- `App::tick` (controller repeats, the speech poll, cloud notices,
//! the audio fades, the speech duck, the state update, presence, the
//! achievement notice) plus `App::visible_lines`, which is everything
//! `App::frame` does once the SDL window is out of the picture -- and it
//! does it over a long, varied mountain route rather than empty interstate.
//!
//! # The route
//!
//! Denver -> Silverthorne -> Edwards -> Glenwood Springs -> Grand Junction:
//! 246 miles of I-70 in four legs. It was chosen because it is the least
//! uniform drive in the world data rather than the longest -- the Front
//! Range climb, the Eisenhower bore, Vail Pass, Glenwood Canyon and the
//! run down to the Grand Valley. All four legs carry full corridor detail
//! (grade segments, elevation samples, lane segments, interchanges,
//! checkpoints, restrictions, speed limits, AADT), so the frames being
//! timed are frames doing the game's real work: grade and curve lookups,
//! zone transitions, traffic in a rolling bubble, hazards, the speech
//! ladder and the event pacer.
//!
//! The route is longer than the run reaches. [`DriveRig::steer`] is a
//! throttle and a brake, not a player, and 63.5 miles in -- most of the way
//! to Silverthorne, over the Divide and down the far side -- it has run the
//! air tanks down and the spring brakes park the truck. That is about
//! 35 000 timed frames, ten minutes of real play, and the report names
//! where and why it ended rather than leaving a reader to assume the road
//! ran out. Anyone extending this should teach the driver the retarder
//! before reaching for a longer route.
//!
//! Traffic and hazards are LEFT ON. `PlaytestHarness` neutralises both
//! (`neutralize_random_trip_friction`) because it is measuring what the
//! game SAYS and traffic makes that non-repeatable; here they are the
//! workload, and the trip seed is what makes them repeatable instead.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! The trip seed is pinned ([`TRIP_SEED`]) and the start hour with it. A
//! seeded trip seeds the weather system too (`WeatherSystem::new`), so the
//! run cannot draw an ice day one morning and a clear one the next -- an
//! unseeded drive picks fresh weather every time and ice changes the whole
//! drive. The event pacer runs on a [`FakeClock`] advanced one frame per
//! frame, for the reason written up on `PlaytestHarness::clock`: on the
//! wall clock a simulated drive outruns real time by two orders of
//! magnitude and the pacer correctly drops almost every ambient line, so
//! the speech half of the frame would go unmeasured.
//!
//! # Which build the numbers come from
//!
//! The report's numbers are from a RELEASE build, because a frame time out
//! of an unoptimised build is not the game's frame time. In this workspace
//! that is a smaller distinction than usual: `[profile.test]` compiles test
//! binaries at `opt-level = 2` even for a plain `cargo test`, and the same
//! drive measured 59.9 us there against 54.1 us under `--release`
//! (2026-08-24). Run it:
//!
//! ```text
//! CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/frame cargo test --release -p freight-fate \
//!     --test frame_time -- bench --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! # Its own binary
//!
//! Not a module of `it`, because a wall-clock gate cannot share a process
//! with 3 000 other tests. Inside `it` the drive thread competes for the
//! CPU with every sibling test's thread and the helper threads those tests
//! start. Run oversubscribed (`--test-threads 16` on four cores,
//! 2026-10-02), the gate's frame was waiting to be scheduled for almost all
//! of its slow frames -- 7.2 ms runnable-but-waiting out of a 7.4 ms frame
//! -- and p99 read 7.4 ms and 10.1 ms against a median of 65 us, the same
//! shape the dev machine showed in a full run (p99 6.7-9.6 ms, median
//! 107 us). Cargo runs test binaries one after another, so here nothing
//! else from the suite is running while a gate times, and [`TIMING`] keeps
//! the gates in this file from timing over each other.
