//! Shared rigging for the screens the drive pushes.
//!
//! Python's fixtures handed each screen `driving`, a plain reference to the
//! `DrivingState` under it. Here the drive lives on the stack as
//! `Rc<RefCell<dyn State>>` and every screen reaches it through a
//! [`DriveRef`], so a test that exercises one of these screens has to put a
//! real drive on the stack first ([`a_drive`]) and reach it back through
//! [`with_drive`] / [`drive_and_ctx`].
