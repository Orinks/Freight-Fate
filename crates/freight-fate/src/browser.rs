//! The one door out of the game and into a web browser.
//!
//! Three callers open a page: the driver-setup verification page during
//! device activation, the driver setup page from the Online hub, the
//! Mastodon link page, and the bug-report form on GitHub. Every one of them
//! goes through [`open_url`], and [`open_url`] refuses unless something has
//! said, in so many words, that this process is the real game.
//!
//! # Why the default is "refuse"
//!
//! This started as an opt-in test seam: `open_url` called the real browser
//! unless a test had installed an override on its own thread. That is fail
//! OPEN -- a test that forgot the override, or code that ran on a worker
//! thread where a per-thread override does not exist, reached the live site
//! and put a real page in front of whoever was at the keyboard. It did
//! exactly that on 2026-08-24: the driver setup page opened in the owner's
//! browser while the suite was running.
//!
//! So the capability is now explicit and process-wide:
//!
//! * [`allow_real_browser`] is called once, by `main()`, and only by
//!   `main()`. A test binary has no `main()` of the game's, so no test
//!   process can ever be granted it.
//! * Until it is called, [`open_url`] records the address in
//!   [`refused_urls`] and panics. It never reaches a browser.
//! * [`set_open_url_override`] is still there, still per thread, and is
//!   still how a test asserts on what the game asked for. It is now a
//!   convenience rather than the thing standing between the suite and the
//!   live site: forgetting it fails the test instead of opening a page.
//!
//! The panic is deliberate. A test author who forgets the override has to
//! be told, and told at the moment it happens; a quiet `false` return would
//! read as "the browser could not be opened", which is a path the game
//! handles gracefully and nobody would ever look at. The real game cannot
//! hit it: the capability is installed as the first thing `main()` does,
//! before a window exists, let alone a menu.
