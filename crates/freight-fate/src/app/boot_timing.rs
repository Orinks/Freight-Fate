//! Where a launch and a quit actually spend their time.
//!
//! Freight Fate boots into a menu a player cannot see, so "it is taking a
//! while" is never a thing they can diagnose and rarely a thing they even
//! report. The only way anyone finds a stall is from the session log, and a
//! log that says what loaded but never says how long it took cannot show one.
//!
//! Each seam of the launch (and of the quit, which is the half that has bitten
//! us) calls [`mark`]; it writes one INFO line naming the phase, the
//! milliseconds that phase took, and the milliseconds since the process
//! started. Read down the `phase:` lines in `logs/game.log` and the slow step
//! is the one with the big number.
//!
//! The clock starts in `main`, before anything else runs, so the first mark
//! also charges process creation and dynamic linking to the launch rather than
//! quietly dropping them.
