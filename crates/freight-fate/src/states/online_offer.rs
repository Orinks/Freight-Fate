//! The one-time offer to connect this computer to an orinks.net account
//! (port of `freight_fate/states/online_offer.py`).
//!
//! Shown once, straight after a first career is created, because nothing else
//! tells a new player the feature exists. Online is optional and stays optional:
//! declining takes one keypress, sets the gate, and is never asked again.
//!
//! The copy says exactly what connecting does: it turns cloud backup and Profile
//! sharing on. It does, since 1.9 -- a connected account that publishes nothing
//! and backs nothing up is a connection that did nothing for the player, and the
//! career statistics on the public profile are read from the backup. The rule
//! behind the wording is unchanged though: a player must never walk away from
//! this prompt with a wrong idea of what is backed up or public, in either
//! direction.
