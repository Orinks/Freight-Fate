//! The traffic you hear is the traffic that is there.
//!
//! Every NPC vehicle near the cab gets a sound: one steady loop for its class
//! (`traffic/<class>_loop`), whose level, pan and pitch are set every frame
//! from where that vehicle really is. A car coming up the left lane swells in
//! the left ear, is loudest alongside, and fades ahead with its pitch dropping
//! as it pulls away; a car crossing in front of a truck stopped at a ramp end
//! sweeps from the ear it came from to the other one, loudest at the
//! crossing. Nothing is scheduled ahead, so nothing can land early or late.
//!
//! This replaced one-shot whooshes (owner, 2026-10-08: "the sounds aren't
//! synced with the NPC traffic"). Those fired when a vehicle crossed the
//! bumper, but each recording peaked somewhere different, from a tenth of a
//! second to well over a second in, so the loudest moment arrived after the
//! car was already gone at ten times pacing; a six-second cooldown dropped
//! most passes outright; and on an exit ramp, where the highway odometer
//! holds, every mainline car still "passed" the truck dead centre as if it
//! drove through the cab.
//!
//! On a ramp the mainline stays where it is: off to the left, getting farther
//! away as the ramp leaves it, so it fades out down the ramp instead of
//! driving through the truck.
//!
//! Under the sounds sits the freeway's own distant traffic, a bed whose level
//! is the road's real presence ([`TrafficManager::freeway_presence_at`]), so a
//! busy interstate sounds busy and a quiet one at three in the morning does
//! not. Off a freeway there is no bed.
//!
//! Earcons, never sentences, for the reason the old whooshes gave: nothing
//! follows from hearing a car go by, and the spoken budget belongs to things
//! that cost money.
//!
