//! The screens the drive itself opens: live status, the driver tablet, the
//! destination facility, and the delivery settlement (port of
//! `freight_fate/states/driving_menu_states.py`).
//!
//! Split by screen, because the Python file was one 1,900-line module:
//!
//! * `driving_menu_states/status.rs` -- [`DrivingStatusState`] and the one
//!   screen it opens, [`DrivingStatusScreenState`] (Route, Driver, Map,
//!   Radio).
//! * `driving_menu_states/apps.rs` -- [`DriverAppsState`] and
//!   [`DriverAppScreenState`], the driver tablet.
//! * `driving_menu_states/facility_arrival.rs` -- [`FacilityArrivalState`].
//! * `driving_menu_states/arrival.rs` -- [`ArrivalState`] and the whole
//!   delivery settlement.
//! * `driving_menu_states/badges.rs` -- the arrival achievement sweep, which
//!   is a third of the Python file on its own.
//! * `driving_menu_states/drive_ref.rs` -- [`DriveRef`], how every screen in
//!   this task reaches the drive it covers. Read its module docs first: it
//!   is the one structural difference from the Python.
//!
//! Python's multiple inheritance is gone. `FacilityArrivalState(
//! FacilityEngineMixin, MenuState)` becomes a struct implementing the
//! existing [`crate::states::driving_core::FacilityEngine`] trait, whose
//! default methods carry the shared engine row exactly as the mixin did.
