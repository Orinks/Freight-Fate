//! The one-time Driving assistance picker: the first screen of a launch
//! until the player has answered it (owner, 2026-09-30).
//!
//! Too many first drives went wrong at the wheel, street corners above all,
//! and a player who hit that on Balanced was never told the choice existed.
//! So everyone answers it once, a fresh install and an existing player
//! alike, before the main menu. The cursor starts on the preset they already
//! have and Escape keeps it; either way `assist_preset_chosen` is spent and
//! the picker never comes back. Changing it later is the Driving assistance
//! preset row, which is the same choice.
