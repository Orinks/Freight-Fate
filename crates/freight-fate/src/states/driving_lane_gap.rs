//! The mirror check a blind driver cannot make: when the lane you left is
//! open again (port of `freight_fate/states/driving_lane_gap.py`, the
//! `LaneGapMixin`).
//!
//! Passing is a two-part manoeuvre and the game only ever spoke the first
//! part. Moving over says "Changing to the left lane" and arriving says "In
//! the left lane", and from there the driver is on their own: the vehicle they
//! are passing makes no sound once it is beside the cab, and nothing says when
//! it is behind them. A sighted player glances at the mirror. A blind player
//! was left guessing, and guessing wrong is a sideswipe -- the collision
//! message even tells them to check mirrors they have no way to check (tester
//! Darren Duff, 1.9.0.dev0: "Not sure how you are supposed to know once you
//! are past vehicles and it's safe to switch lanes again").
//!
//! So the pass gets its closing half: one line, when the lane behind the
//! manoeuvre is genuinely open again.
//!
//! * **The same authority that judges the collision.** `_finish_lane_change`
//!   asks the traffic manager whether the lane it arrived in is occupied. This
//!   asks the same question of the lane the driver came from, through the same
//!   `vehicle_in_lane` call, over a window a margin WIDER than the collision
//!   test uses -- and swept forward over the real seconds a driver spends
//!   acting on the answer. A static margin was not enough: traffic moves on
//!   compressed game time, so at highway compression a cruise closing on
//!   slowed traffic ate half a mile between "Right lane open" and the drift
//!   landing, and the lane the cue had honestly called open sideswiped anyway
//!   (tester Jerry Jicha, 1.9.0.dev0: "if it says it is open, then it is
//!   open"). Open now means open until the driver is across.
//! * **Once per vehicle passed.** Latched on the vehicle's key, like the
//!   pass-by whoosh. A car riding the edge of the window must not chant.
//! * **Only while it is still true.** Back in that lane, out of it by a fresh
//!   change, stopped, or the road took the lane away, and the watch is dropped
//!   without a word. A closed lane is never called open.
//!
//! The same clearance reading answers the L key on demand, so a driver who
//! missed the line -- or who wants to know before committing -- can ask.
