//! What a tank load sounds like from the driver's seat (port of
//! `freight_fate/states/driving_liquid.py`, the `LiquidLoadMixin`).
//!
//! The physics live in `sim::surge`. This is the part the player actually
//! meets: a gated cue layer that is completely silent on steady cruise and on
//! every other kind of freight, and that comes alive from the moment the liquid
//! starts running until it has settled again.
//!
//! Three decisions shape all of it.
//!
//! **The wave is sonified by its speed, not its force.** The oscillator's
//! velocity leads its displacement by a quarter period, and the force the truck
//! feels goes with displacement. So playing the liquid's *motion* means the
//! sound peaks a quarter cycle -- one and a half to three seconds, on these
//! tanks -- before the shove arrives. That warning is not predicted, estimated
//! or faked; it is the same relationship that makes a swing loudest at the
//! bottom and highest at the ends. Nothing is being modelled twice, and there
//! is nothing for a driver to learn to distrust.
//!
//! **Rate carries the danger.** A half-full smooth bore rolls slowly: a long,
//! late, heavy wave. A baffled tank slaps quickly and dies. The player hears
//! which one they are hauling in the tempo of wash and hit rather than in a
//! level, because tempo survives a mono speaker, a low effects volume, and the
//! jake brake running at full gain on top of it -- and level does not.
//!
//! **Nothing is panned.** Left and right are already fully spoken for: the road
//! bed's pan is the lane-guidance instrument and the edge ladder's is the drift
//! side. A tanker drifting in a bend would otherwise put three separate things
//! on one axis. Fore and aft is not a decision the driver makes anyway -- only
//! the timing and the size of the wave are -- so those are what get encoded.
//!
//! The sound sits high on purpose. The engine and the road own everything below
//! a kilohertz, and the jake is loudest at exactly the moment surge matters, so
//! this layer plays the *surface* of the liquid -- the wash and the slap against
//! the head, up where nothing else lives.
