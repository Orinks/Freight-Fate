//! Everyday pool billboards that notice the drive, swapped at speak time
//! (`ff_core::data::billboards_dynamic` has the lines and the rules).

//! The pool is drawn when the trip starts; what Big Jim and the small-hours

//! as a pool sign is read. Placed attraction signs (`billboard_sign`) pass
//! through untouched.
