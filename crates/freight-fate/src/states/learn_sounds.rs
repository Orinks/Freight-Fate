//! Learn game sounds: hear a cue and what it means, before it matters (port
//! of `freight_fate/states/learn_sounds.py`).
//!
//! Two screens. The first lists the catalog's categories; the second lists
//! the cues inside one and plays them on request.
//!
//! Arrowing speaks the name and nothing else, the way every other menu in
//! the game behaves. Enter plays the cue, and Enter again replays it. A cue
//! that fired while its own name was being spoken would teach the player the
//! collision rather than the cue, and holding Down would machine-gun the
//! audio, so nothing here plays on movement.
