//! The two moments a career changes shape: losing the seat, losing the truck
//! (port of `freight_fate/states/career_setback.py`).
//!
//! Both are the longest and most consequential things the game ever says, and
//! both remove the tractor the driver was in. A single spoken line would be
//! gone to the first keypress, so each one lands as a screen the player can
//! arrow through, re-read line by line, and leave when they are ready -- the
//! same cadence as the save notices.
//!
//! Neither is an ending. The save is intact, the career is intact, and there
//! is freight on the board in the morning; the last line of every notice says
//! where to go next, and the screen refuses to close without the player
//! acknowledging it.
