//! Backing down a live road: the one manoeuvre nothing used to object to
//! (port of `freight_fate/states/driving_wrong_way.py`, the `WrongWayMixin`).
//!
//! Reverse exists for the yard and the dock, and the sim already prices its
//! abuse -- the box refuses reverse above a walking pace, and holding a loaded
//! rig against its governor in reverse wears the engine out. What none of that
//! covers is *where*. The adversarial harness backed a tractor-trailer a full
//! mile down an interstate to route mile zero, and the only thing the game
//! said in all that time was a merge instruction for the exit it was reversing
//! away from. A sighted player would at least see the world sliding the wrong
//! way; a blind player had nothing at all, which makes this an accessibility
//! gap before it is a realism one.
//!
//! Backing on a travelled lane is prohibited outright on a controlled-access
//! highway and is how real drivers get hit, so the ladder here is short and it
//! escalates on distance rather than time:
//!
//! * **the reminder** -- past a truck length or two, say which way the truck
//!   is going and what it is undoing. This is the line the harness was looking
//!   for.
//! * **the warning** -- past a tenth of a mile, name it as illegal, because by
//!   then it is not a misjudged dock approach, and give the distance back so
//!   the player knows how far they have to make up.
//! * **traffic** -- past a quarter mile, the road stops being empty. Reversing
//!   into a live lane is a collision waiting to happen, and the collision is
//!   what a real driver would meet.
//!
//! Legitimate backing is exempt: the yard, the dock approach, a facility gate
//! zone, and anywhere within reach of a stop the player pulled into. A driver
//! lining up on a dock must never be scolded for doing their job.
