//! Port of `freight_fate/online_activation.py` — device-code activation:
//! replaces the clipboard-paste credential setup.
//!
//! The old flow made a player copy a Driver ID and a token from the Orinks
//! driver setup page and paste both into the game (see
//! `online_presence::OnlineIdentity`). That is error-prone for a screen
//! reader user working across two applications with no shared clipboard
//! review. This module instead drives the OAuth-device-code style exchange
//! already live on orinks.net: the game asks for a short code, speaks it, the
//! player types that code into any browser (any device) and signs in there,
//! and the game polls until the site says the code was claimed.
//!
//! This is the *only* place that knows about the two activation endpoints. It
//! deliberately reuses `net::Transport`, `online_presence::http_json`, and
//! `online_presence::base_url` rather than forking them, so the game has
//! exactly one HTTP client and exactly one `FREIGHT_FATE_ONLINE_URL` override
//! for every Orinks endpoint.
//!
//! Both request/response shapes below are an existing, already-deployed server
//! contract -- do not change field names or status-code meanings here without
//! updating the server first.

/// An opaque, stable name for this computer, for the computer list.
///
/// orinks.net caps an account at ten computers and used to count
/// ACTIVATIONS: every freshly unzipped build that connected took another
/// slot, so a tester who takes a build a week filled the list with one PC
/// and was locked out (armstrong445, 2026-08-15). Sending this lets the
/// server replace that computer's entry instead of adding one.
///
/// Hashed, and never the hostname itself: the server only ever compares it
/// for equality, so there is no reason to hand over a name that might be a
/// person's. Python derived it from `uuid.getnode()` (the primary MAC) and
/// `platform.node()`: stable across a reinstall and across unzipping the
/// game somewhere else -- the two things that were minting duplicate rows.
///
/// On Windows this port reproduces that derivation exactly (the same
/// `UuidCreateSequential` node `uuid.getnode()` reads, and the same
/// `gethostname()`), so a computer activated by the Python build keeps its
/// row. Elsewhere there is no cheap MAC lookup without a new dependency, so
/// the seed is the hostname plus a random install key persisted once in
/// `data_dir` (`machine.key`): stable across reinstalls over the same data
/// directory, a fresh row when the game is unzipped somewhere new. That is
/// the documented deviation; the wire contract (32 lowercase hex characters
/// the server only ever compares) is unchanged.

/// This is NOT identity and never authenticates anything: it is a hint the
/// player triggers by deliberately connecting, and a wrong or missing one
