//! Reading and driving a menu that the caller does not know the type of.
//!
//! # Why this is not `state.items`
//!
//! The Python harness reached straight for `getattr(app.state, "items", [])`
//! and compared `item.text` to a label. Rust's [`MenuItem`] is generic in the
//! screen that owns it (`MenuItem<S>`), so [`Menu`] is not object safe and
//! there is no `&dyn Menu` to ask. The typed way -- `with_state::<T>` and a
//! turbofish -- is what the per-screen tests use, and it is right there,
//! but the harness walks screens it deliberately does not name: the pickup
//! menu hands over to a shipper it did not choose, the arrival menu offers
//! whichever kind of receiver dispatch drew.
//!
//! So the harness reads the rows the same way a sighted helper does, off
//! `State::lines`. Every menu renders its rows last, one per line, each
//! prefixed `"> "` (focused) or `"  "`, after a blank separator line -- the
//! `Menu::lines` default and every screen that overrides it (the pickup
//! facility's status block, the settings screen) both. That is a contract
//! the visible window already depends on, and a screen that broke it would
//! be unreadable on screen before it was unreadable here.
//!
//! [`MenuItem`]: crate::states::base::MenuItem
//! [`Menu`]: crate::states::base::Menu
