//! Dynamic weather with regional flavor, driving modifiers, and forecasts.
//!
//! Weather evolves as a Markov chain. Each condition carries physics
//! modifiers (grip, drag, visibility) and an ambience sound key. A
//! deterministic seed makes trips reproducible in tests.
//!
//! Two clocks: the career/season clock (night, calendar, temperature) still
//! advances on game minutes, the same drive-time law as fuel and HOS. Spoken
//! weather color -- the condition timer and thunder -- ticks on sitting
//! minutes so 20x does not spawn 20x pokes. A rest skip uses game minutes
//! for both, because the skip is the time that passed.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/sim/weather.py`.
