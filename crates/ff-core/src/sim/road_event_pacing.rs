//! Real-seconds breathing gaps for the routine road talkers.
//!
//! Time compression spends road 10-40x faster than a real cab, so systems
//! that announce on road distance -- posted-limit arrivals, traffic calls,
//! zone chatter -- pile their lines back to back in every driving mode
//! (owner report, 2026-08-13). The clock stays (career pacing is balanced
//! on it); the ANNOUNCEMENTS space out instead, in wall-clock seconds, the
//! same law the corner warnings and the keeper's ease already follow.
//!
//! The gate lives at the SOURCE, before any state mutates: a caller that
//! finds its window shut simply does nothing, and the next natural check
//! after the window opens announces the CURRENT state. Superseding is free
//! -- nothing is held, so nothing goes stale.
//!
//! Safety and action lines never come here: hazards, AEB, pacenotes, scale
//! and stop calls, maneuvers, enforcement, merge warnings, and every answer
//! to a player's key speak immediately, always.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/sim/road_event_pacing.py`.
