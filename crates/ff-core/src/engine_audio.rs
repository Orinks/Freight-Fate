//! Engine-audio state: maps the truck's physical state to what the engine
//! should SOUND like, independent of any audio backend or sample set.
//!
//! Today the engine is one idle loop pitch-slid by rpm (`audio.engine_freq_mult`),
//! so it cannot tell a truck parked and warming up from one pulling a grade. This
//! module is the small brain that names the situation instead:
//!
//! ```text
//!   off         engine not running
//!   park_idle   parked, air still building -- the "neutral park" character
//!   ready_idle  parked, air up, drive-ready -- the FLIP target (Josh's cue)
//!   launch      pulling away from a stop
//!   cruise      rolling in gear
//!   reverse     backing up (the parking/backing mechanic keys off this)
//! ```
//!
//! The park_idle -> ready_idle FLIP fires exactly when the air system reaches the
//! governor release (`air_ready`): start cold, it fast-idles while it builds air,
//! then flips to the settled drive-ready idle -- the sound Josh liked in 896. A
//! separate `pressurizing` overlay flag (engine on, air not yet ready) drives the
//! air-fill loop regardless of which idle is playing.
//!
//! Pure logic: [`classify`] takes primitives so it is trivially testable, and
//! [`reading_from_truck`] adapts a live truck through the [`EngineTruck`]
//! trait. The playback layer (multisample selection, pitch tracking,
//! crossfades) consumes the result; this module owns the gameplay contract
//! that the engine voice and the parking feature both read.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/engine_audio.py`.

/// The named engine situations (also the contract the parking/backing
/// feature reads). [`EngineState::as_str`] gives the Python spelling.
