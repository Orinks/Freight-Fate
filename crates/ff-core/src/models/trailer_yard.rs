//! Trailer yards, drop-and-hook, and the trailer you are actually pulling
//! (port of `freight_fate/models/trailer_yard.py`).
//!
//! Freight Fate already knew what *kind* of trailer a load needs (see
//! `trailers::CARGO_TRAILER_COMPATIBILITY`), but not that trailers are
//! physical things sitting in yards. That gap swallowed the single biggest
//! difference between one pickup and another: whether the driver waits at a
//! dock while the freight goes on, or drops the box they came in with and
//! hooks one that was loaded hours ago.
//!
//! Both are real and the trade is real:
//!
//! - **Live load.** Back into a dock and wait. An hour if the shipper is
//!   sharp, considerably longer if not -- and past the free time the carrier
//!   bills detention, which is money the driver earns for sitting still.
//! - **Drop and hook.** Twenty-odd minutes: drop, hook, crank the gear, do
//!   the paperwork, gone. It is why big carriers chase it. The catch is that
//!   you get the trailer you get, and nobody in that yard has looked at it
//!   since it was parked.
//!
//! Which one a load is depends on the facility. High-volume freight -- a
//! distribution centre, a parcel hub, an intermodal ramp -- stages preloaded
//! trailers as a matter of course. A farm elevator or a quarry does not.
//!
//! Nothing here is saved. Yards are derived from the facility's own identity,
//! so the same dock always holds the same iron without a byte of profile
//! schema; the one trailer that has to persist is the one currently hooked,
//! and that rides in the trip snapshot with the rest of the run.
//!
//! The Python `settlement <-> trailer_yard` import cycle is broken here by
//! [`DetentionCharge`]: `detention_charge` returns that local record, carrying
//! exactly the `SettlementCharge` fields, and `models::settlement` (wave 2)
//! converts it rather than this module importing the ledger type.
