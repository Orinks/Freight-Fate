//! Sets of doubles: what a second trailer and a converter dolly add.
//!
//! Two programs hook two trailers behind a converter dolly: `double_van`
//! (STAA twin 28-foot pups for `parcel_doubles`) and `turnpike_double`
//! (48-foot LCV turnpike doubles for `turnpike_doubles`). This module holds
//! the numbers that set them apart from a single trailer, each marked the way
//! the rest of the sim marks its figures: READ straight from the cited source,
//! DERIVED from READ figures by the arithmetic shown, or ASSUMED where no
//! public figure was found (those are open questions for realism review).
//!
//! * **Hook-up time.** Two trailers and a dolly are two hook-ups, not one, and
//!   the pre-trip walk-around covers both trailers and the dolly.
//! * **Tare.** Both trailers and the dolly count in the gross weight.
//! * **Rearward amplification.** In a quick lane change the rear trailer of a
//!   set swings harder than the tractor that started it.
//! * **Legal gross.** STAA pups stay at the federal 80,000 lb; turnpike
//!   doubles take the recorded per-state turnpike cap.
