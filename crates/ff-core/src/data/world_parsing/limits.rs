/// 2026-08-11, and again on 2026-08-12 after the first attempt at this).
///
/// That first attempt asked for a fixed MILE, and a mile is not one
/// experience: at 70 the truck is through it in under three real seconds and
/// at 30 it takes over ten. So the bar is real seconds now -- the same law
/// the keeper ease, the turn call and the zone warning already follow -- and
/// converting it back to miles at each posting's own speed does for free what
/// the mile bar needed an exception to do, because slow road is barely
/// compressed. A 70 has to hold for over two miles; a 30 needs two thirds of
/// one.
///
/// The exception survives for the case seconds alone still cannot judge: a
/// genuinely short main street. A place within `LIMIT_PLACE_NEAR_MI` halves
/// the bar, but only for a drop to a speed a place actually posts. Shaving
/// five off a highway limit beside a village is not the village's doing, and
/// the old unconditional pass is what kept 763 sub-three-second postings,
/// including quarter-mile interstate trims.
///
/// Sibling of the timezone dwell filter and the state-crossing sanitizer: the
/// same "a boundary that does not last is not a boundary" rule, applied to
/// the third profile baked out of way geometry. The run is measured against
/// the last posting KEPT, so a chain of slivers collapses whole rather than
