//! Big Buck's -- roadside-landmark mini-game content, spoken line pools
//! (port of `freight_fate/data/big_bucks.py`).
//!
//! Big Buck's is an original parody of the famous Texas travel-center chain
//! that bans big rigs. This is the CONTENT layer: the spoken lines the
//! landmark interaction draws from, authored as data so it stays the
//! map/content author's lane and unit-tests with no audio. The interaction
//! STATE that consumes these pools -- the gate turn-away menu, the one-time
//! hint flag, the menace/ban escalation, the crowd cooldown -- is
//! gameplay-layer follow-on. It pairs with the amenities brand layer's
//! `Brand { key: "big_bucks", bans_big_rigs: true }`.
//!
//! Two refusal flavors, kept mechanically distinct:
//!
//! * STRUCTURAL -- your fault. You showed up trailered (loaded or deadhead,
//!   still an eighteen-wheeler): no-big-rigs signage, then a one-time teaching
//!   hint, then escalating menace lines, then a temporary ban plus a
//!   reputation ding. Comes from the truck's configuration, so it is
//!   deterministic.
//! * SITUATIONAL -- not your fault. Even bobtail and welcome, the lot can be
//!   mobbed. A soft "come back later" with NO penalty, mirroring the full-lot
//!   rest stop.
//!
//! Every string here is player-facing speech: no codes, no map tags, and
//! numbers spelled in words where a bare figure would read oddly through a
//! screen reader.
