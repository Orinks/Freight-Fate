# Company Driver To Owner-Operator Arc

This design keeps Freight Fate's owner-operator fantasy, but grounds the path
in a real trucking progression instead of making a risky lease-purchase deal
the main dream.

## Grounding

The realistic first step is not instant independence. A new company-path driver
starts with one of several fictional starter carriers. The carrier controls the
dispatch relationship, assigns and maintains the tractor/trailer combination,
and carries the normal carrier costs. The driver earns wages and bonuses from
each settlement, while fines and damaged-load consequences still matter.

The first owner-operator step is modeled as a leased-on owner-operator, not full
motor-carrier authority. That keeps the game focused on driving and load choice:
the player buys into a tractor position and pays operating costs, but the
carrier still anchors dispatch, trailers, authority support, settlement, and
reimbursed accessorials. The later own-authority step is intentionally limited:
it unlocks direct freight and extra business overhead, but does not pretend to
simulate every DOT, MC, insurance, broker, or tax detail.

The progression intentionally avoids making lease-purchase the happy path. The
FMCSA Truck Leasing Task Force exists because lease and lease-purchase
arrangements can create serious risk for drivers, and those risks are the wrong
tone for the first playable business arc. The game therefore uses a clear
buy-in and working-capital gate instead of a confusing weekly deduction trap.

Freight Fate also offers an alternate owner-operator start for players who want
that fantasy immediately. It is framed as an experienced-driver start: the
player begins leased on with an owned starter tractor, higher gross revenue,
limited working capital, partial fuel, light equipment wear, and operating
costs active from day one.

## Gameplay Model

- Company driver: listed board pay is carrier gross; settlement pays a driver
  wage/bonus. Fuel, routine repairs, roadside fuel, and carrier shop repair are
  billed to the carrier. The driver may have a regular assigned tractor, but
  does not own, switch, or upgrade tractors yet.
- Starter carrier differences: company carriers adjust realistic wage and
  dispatch factors: pay share, per-mile wage floor, stop pay, on-time bonus,
  route-length mix, deadline slack, regional tendency, and modest freight
  emphasis. They do not grant magic perks or personal truck ownership.
- Leased-on owner-operator: listed board pay is gross revenue; settlement adds
  a higher revenue multiplier, then deducts business costs: maintenance reserve,
  insurance reserve, trailer program, truck payment reserve, and settlement
  service fee. Fuel and repairs also come out of the player's cash.
  Truck purchases, switching, and upgrades unlock here because the player now
  has owned tractor responsibility.
- Trailer compatibility: cargo now maps to trailer programs. Company drivers
  use carrier-provided trailers. Leased-on owner-operators start with a dry van
  trailer program and can add reefer, flatbed, or bulk programs from the garage.
  Missing specialty programs lock matching cargo until the player adds them.
- Own authority and direct freight: prepared owner-operators can activate a
  limited own-authority mode from Business status at level 25, with 75
  deliveries, reputation 92, a specialty trailer program, no pay advance, and
  enough cash to pay 15,000 dollars while keeping 35,000 dollars working
  capital. Direct freight pays higher gross revenue, then settlement deducts
  insurance, compliance, trailer program or owned-trailer reserve, truck
  reserve, and factoring costs.
- Trailer ownership: own-authority drivers can buy dry van, reefer, flatbed,
  or bulk trailers from the garage. Matching direct freight then uses an
  owned-trailer reserve instead of the trailer-program charge. Leased-on
  owner-operators still use carrier trailer programs, and company drivers still
  use carrier-provided trailers.
- Progression: levels 1-15 are company-driver and senior company-driver ranks.
  Levels 16-17 prepare the owner-operator transition, but the leased-on buy-in
  does not unlock until level 18 with 35 deliveries, reputation 80, no pay
  advance, and enough cash for a 35,000 dollar buy-in while keeping 10,000
  dollars of working capital.
- The design remains a driving career, not a fleet-management sim. It adds one
  terminal menu and settlement math; it does not add driver hiring, tax filing,
  direct broker negotiation, or full authority paperwork management.
- Level-20 owner-operators can set aside an authority prep reserve when
  their reputation, delivery count, and working capital are ready. It is the
  prerequisite for the later own-authority activation gate.

## Dispatch Autonomy

Freedom to choose freight and routing is itself a progression reward
(`dispatch_policy` in `models/dispatch_policy.py`):

| Band | Gate | Load | Route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New company hire | Company driver below level 8 | Assigned: one offered load with accept/decline | Assigned: dispatch picks the lane |
| Senior company driver | Company driver at level 8+ | Chosen from the dispatch board | Assigned |
| Owner-operator / own authority | Leased-on or independent | Chosen from the dispatch board | Chosen from the route options |

A new hire can decline a limited number of assigned loads before the next
promotion (dispatch draws the next candidate), but each refusal costs
reputation -- refusing freight is remembered by dispatch, matching forced
dispatch at real starter carriers. When the budget runs out, the board locks
to accept-only until the next level-up refills it. Owner-operators never see
the assignment flow: choosing freight and lanes is the independence the
buy-in purchases, which also removes the often-single-option route menu from
the company-driver game where it was a no-op.

## Career Start Choices

| Start | Mode | Practical Tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Northstar Freight Lines | Company driver | Balanced wage plan and broad dispatch. |
| Great Lakes Training Transport | Company driver | Better short-load stop pay, more short-haul training work, and slightly more forgiving deadlines. |
| Prairie Link Regional | Company driver | Better per-mile wage floor, lower stop pay, more same-region work, and grain/bulk emphasis. |
| Summit Value Logistics | Company driver | Better percentage and on-time bonus, smaller guarantee, and more long-haul/high-value lanes. |
| Owner-operator start | Leased-on owner-operator | Starts at level 18 with owned starter equipment, 18,000 dollars working capital, partial fuel, light wear, higher gross revenue, and operating costs active. |

## 30-Level Arc

| Level | Rank | Business Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yard Trainee | Start with a company carrier and an assigned company tractor. |
| 2 | New Hire Company Driver | Refrigerated freight unlocks. |
| 3 | Solo Company Driver | Heavy-haul freight unlocks. |
| 4 | Regional Company Driver | High-value freight unlocks. |
| 5 | Regional Regular | Broader regional lane variety while still company-paid. |
| 6 | Experienced Company Driver | Better company-driver lanes. |
| 7 | Long-Haul Company Driver | Long-haul dispatch becomes routine. |
| 8 | Heavy Freight Driver | More machinery, construction, and bulk opportunities. |
| 9 | High-Value Company Driver | Higher-consequence freight trust. |
| 10 | Lead Company Driver | Senior company-driver status. |
| 11 | Specialized Company Driver | Endorsements and careful service carry more weight. |
| 12 | Premium Lane Driver | Better carrier lane quality. |
| 13 | Carrier Mentor Driver | Stronger reputation weight with dispatch. |
| 14 | Business Prep Driver | Owner-operator checklist starts to matter. |
| 15 | Owner-Operator Candidate | Working-capital target becomes visible. |
| 16 | Leased-On Applicant | Leased-on requirements appear in full. |
| 17 | Tractor Buy-In Candidate | Tractor buy-in target is active. |
| 18 | Leased-On Owner-Operator | Buy-in can unlock leased-on owner-operator economics. |
| 19 | Settled Owner-Operator | Owner-operator settlements become normal. |
| 20 | Established Owner-Operator | Specialty trailer programs matter more. |
| 21 | Authority Prep Candidate | Authority prep reserve can unlock. |
| 22 | Direct Freight Prep | Direct freight readiness gates become clearer. |
| 23 | Trailer Strategy Owner | Trailer ownership planning matters for direct freight. |
| 24 | Authority-Ready Operator | Final authority activation checklist. |
| 25 | Independent Authority Operator | Own authority and direct freight can unlock. |
| 26 | Contract Freight Builder | Premium direct freight reputation matters more. |
| 27 | Specialized Trailer Operator | Specialized trailer opportunities stand out. |
| 28 | Premium Lane Operator | Premium lanes favor high reputation and the right trailer. |
| 29 | Veteran Independent Operator | Prestige freight and best dispatch quality. |
| 30 | Freight Fate Independent | Top one-driver owner-operator rank. |

Level 30 completes the extended owner-operator career arc. The own-authority
mode begins at level 25 when the other gates are met, then levels 26-30 make the
endgame feel like an established independent driving business. It is still not a
fleet or brokerage simulator.

## Authority Prep Reserve

Authority readiness is the first concrete hook toward true authority without
turning Freight Fate into a compliance sim. A leased-on owner-operator at level
21 can set aside a 12,500 dollar reserve after 60 deliveries, reputation 90, and
25,000 dollars of working capital. At level 25, the player can activate own
authority with 75 deliveries, reputation 92, at least one specialty trailer
program, no pay advance, and enough cash to pay the 15,000 dollar startup cost
while keeping 35,000 dollars of working capital.

The active own-authority mode changes the dispatch board to direct freight.
Listed pay has higher gross upside, and settlement adds insurance, compliance,
trailer program or owned-trailer reserve, truck reserve, and factoring costs.
This represents the business responsibility at a playable scale; it does not
model every filing, broker agreement, or delayed-pay negotiation.

## Trailer Programs And Ownership

Trailer compatibility uses the same cargo fit for both leased programs and
owned trailers:

| Program | Cargo Fit |
| --- | --- |
| Dry van | General, retail, parcel, automotive, electronics, packaged chemicals, and some container, farm, construction, lumber, and paper freight. |
| Reefer | Fresh food and refrigerated cargo. |
| Flatbed | Steel, machinery, construction, lumber, paper, and some container freight. |
| Bulk | Grain, farm inputs, and loose bulk materials. |

The dry van program is included for leased-on owner-operators. Reefer, flatbed,
and bulk programs are leased from the garage. They are not lease-purchase deals
and do not create weekly debt traps.

Own-authority drivers can buy the same four trailer types outright. Owned
trailers are expensive up front, but matching direct freight uses a smaller
owned-trailer reserve at settlement instead of the trailer-program charge. The
first ownership slice does not add trailer condition, financing, resale, or
washout work. Tanker freight is not implemented yet because current chemical
cargo is packaged industrial freight, not liquid bulk tanker work.

## Follow-Up Realism Hooks

- Own authority now has a first playable step. Future work should deepen it
  with real authority application timing, insurance filings, broker/load-board
  tiers, delayed settlement or factoring choices, and clearer compliance
  overhead.
- Authority prep remains the entry gate for that advanced authority work.
- Trailer ownership has a first own-authority dealer slice. Future work can add
  owned trailer condition, financing, tanker cargo, washout, and trailer resale.
- Operating-cost polish should keep using recognizable owner-operator cost
  categories, but player-facing settlement text should stay concise and avoid
  dense finance jargon.
- Freight-market pricing should keep company-driver wages, leased-on gross
  revenue, and own-authority spot or broker rates distinct, with clear gross
  and settlement-cost wording on direct freight.
- Lease-purchase remains a realism caveat and caution, not the default success
  path. Fleet hiring and company ownership stay separate from this driving arc.
- A future save-schema cleanup can rename internal `truck` and `owned_trucks`
  fields so legacy saves keep loading without those fields sounding like
  company-driver ownership in code.
